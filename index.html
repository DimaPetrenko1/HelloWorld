        <h2 align="center">  GRETSCH  WHITE  FALKON  </h2>

        <p align="center">This guitar was created as a "showpiece" to exhibit the craft of Gretsch's luthiers, sales,
             and demonstration representative, Jimmie Webster, who created it for the 1954 NAMM Show.<br>
              The guitar was so popular that it was put into production and went on sale the following year.
               Since then, it has undergone various changes and is still being made today.<br> As of 2013,
                Gretsch offers a number of guitars in its "Falcon" series, including a custom-built replica of the original,
                 which is priced in the US at $12,000 (approximately Â£8300).</p>

        <p align="center">The White Falcon's distinctive appearance is owed to its 17-inch size
             (white, with gold-sparkle pickguard featuring an engraved falcon)<br>
              and its hardware: Jimmie Webster's 1954 version had triple binding, gold-plated hardware,
               an ebony fretboard with mother-of-pearl inlays, and an eye-catching "Cadillac G" tailpiece.</p>
